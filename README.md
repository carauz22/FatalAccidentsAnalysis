The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is an agency of the U.S. federal government, part of the Department of Transportation. It describes its mission as saving lives, preventing injuries, and reducing economic costs due to road traffic crashes through education, research, safety standards, and enforcement activity. The NHTSA statement regarding a child’s death in a car reads, “Nearly 900 children died of heatstroke since 1998 because they were left or became trapped in a hot car. Everyone needs to understand that children are more vulnerable to heatstroke and that all hot car deaths are preventable. We — as parents, caregivers, and bystanders — play a role in helping to make sure another death doesn’t happen”.
